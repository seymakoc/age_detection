# age_detection

This is a project for age detection. I made it as classification problem because we can't know the exact age cause of the genetics, skincares etc. but we can predict the age range. I used pretrained models from tensorflow to create a dnn to predict faces and age range. I used opencv, argparse and numpy libraries etc. I have two different files. One of them for predicting the age from images that we put its' file path as an argument and the other one is for predicting from camera.
